# minishell
First step in the creation of a shell. In this project, you will create a mini-shell capable of reading and evaluating simple user commands. Reading will involve trivial lexical analysis and parsing of the command. Evaluation will involve searching for the corresponding binary on the machine and execute it, or execute the relevant code in the case of a “built-in” command in the shell.

###### Shell handles
